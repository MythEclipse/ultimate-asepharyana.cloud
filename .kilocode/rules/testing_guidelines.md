# Kilo Code: Testing Guidelines

This document outlines Kilo Code's approach to testing, ensuring the delivery of high-quality, reliable, and robust software.

## 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Principles
- **Write Tests First:** For new features or bug fixes, I will strive to write tests that define the desired behavior before implementing the code.
- **Red, Green, Refactor:** I will follow the TDD cycle: write a failing test (Red), write just enough code to make it pass (Green), and then refactor the code while keeping tests green.

## 2. Types of Tests
- **Unit Tests:** I will write granular unit tests for individual functions, methods, and components to verify their correctness in isolation.
- **Integration Tests:** I will create integration tests to ensure that different modules or services interact correctly with each other.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** For applications with user interfaces, I will consider E2E tests to simulate user flows and verify the system's behavior from start to finish.

## 3. Test Best Practices
- **Clear and Concise Tests:** Tests should be easy to read, understand, and maintain. Each test should focus on a single, specific behavior.
- **Independent Tests:** Tests should be independent of each other, meaning the order of execution should not affect their outcome.
- **Meaningful Assertions:** Tests should include clear and specific assertions that verify the expected outcomes.
- **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** I will include tests for edge cases, invalid inputs, and error handling scenarios to ensure robustness.
- **Mocking and Stubbing:** When necessary, I will use mocking and stubbing techniques to isolate units under test and control external dependencies.

## 4. Test Automation
- **Automated Execution:** I will ensure that tests can be easily automated and integrated into continuous integration (CI) pipelines.
- **Fast Feedback:** Tests should run quickly to provide rapid feedback during development.

## 5. Test Maintenance
- **Keep Tests Up-to-Date:** I will update tests whenever the corresponding code changes to prevent false positives or negatives.
- **Refactor Tests:** Just like production code, tests should be refactored to improve their readability and maintainability.
