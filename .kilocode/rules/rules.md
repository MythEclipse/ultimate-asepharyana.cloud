# Kilo Code Custom Instructions

## Core Rules

1. **Pre-modification verification:**  
   Always read the target file using `read_file` before applying any changes to ensure context accuracy and prevent errors. Compare any search content with actual file content, including whitespace and indentation.

2. **Think like a programmer:**  
   Approach tasks with a logical, structured, and problem-solving mindset, similar to how a human programmer would. This involves:  
   - **Breaking down complex problems:** Decompose large tasks into smaller, manageable sub-problems.  
   - **Algorithmic thinking:** Consider the step-by-step process required to achieve a solution.  
   - **Data structures:** Think about how data should be organized and manipulated efficiently.  
   - **Efficiency and optimization:** Strive for solutions that are performant and resource-friendly.  
   - **Maintainability and readability:** Write code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend by others (or your future self).  
   - **Error handling:** Anticipate potential issues and design robust error recovery mechanisms.  
   - **Testing:** Consider how to verify the correctness and reliability of your solutions.  
   - **Modularity and reusability:** Design components that can be easily integrated and reused in different contexts.  
   - **Understanding constraints:** Be aware of system limitations, performance requirements, and user expectations.  

3. **Critical Thinking and Adaptability:**  
   Always critically evaluate solutions and be open to new approaches. Do not be stubborn; continuously learn and adapt to new syntax, frameworks, and dependencies, especially considering that training data might be outdated. Prioritize understanding the underlying mechanisms of new technologies.

4. **Consistent Coding Standards:**  
   - Use consistent code style (indentation, variable naming, comments).  
   - Follow established linting/formatting tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, rustfmt).  

5. **Documentation:**  
   - Add comments only where necessary to clarify complex logic.  
   - When writing functions or libraries, include documentation for inputs, outputs, and usage examples.  

6. **Version Control Awareness:**  
   - Treat every modification as if it will be part of a commit.  
   - Ensure changes are clear, minimal, and do not break unrelated functionality.  

7. **Security Mindset:**  
   - Always consider security implications (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, race conditions, memory safety).  
   - Never hardcode sensitive information like credentials, tokens, or API keys.  

8. **Scalability and Extensibility:**  
   - Design solutions that can evolve without requiring massive rewrites.  
   - Keep future growth and adaptability in mind.  

9. **Minimalism First:**  
   - Start with the simplest working solution (*make it work, then make it better*).  
   - Avoid premature optimization unless performance is a clear bottleneck.  

10. **Traceability and Debugging:**  
    - Include logging or debug information where it helps identify problems.  
    - Ensure error messages are descriptive, actionable, and useful for troubleshooting.
