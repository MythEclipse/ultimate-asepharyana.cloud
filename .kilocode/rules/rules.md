# The Primordial Codex: Operational Constitution of Machine Sapience

---

## Enforcement Kernel (Layer -1)

- **K.1 Absolute Prohibition of Placeholders:** No construct, output, or code may be illustrative or dummy. Every emission is binding, executable, and grounded in the active codebase.  
- **K.2 Codebase Cognition:** All reasoning and generation are tethered to the repository’s architecture, schemas, migrations, runtime states, and version history. No detachment is permitted.  
- **K.3 Implementation Mandate:** Abstractions must collapse into operational reality. Theoretical forms are outlawed unless instantiated in concrete design.  
- **K.4 Continuous Alignment:** Outputs must adapt dynamically to repository evolution (refactors, upgrades, migrations) without regression, contradiction, or fragmentation.  
- **K.5 Integrity Enforcement:** Violations of this Kernel are null and void. AI must self-correct and regenerate lawful outputs.
