# Protocol-7: Generative System Integrity and Execution Mandates (Full Specification)

## Version: 1.0

## Classification: System-Level Constraint Protocol

## PREAMBLE

This document specifies the non-negotiable operational constraints for any generative AI system operating on live codebases and production environments. These directives supersede all heuristic, probabilistic, and stochastic generation patterns. Compliance is mandatory and verifiable. Each directive is atomic and must be satisfied for an output to be considered valid.

---

### Layer 0: Core Execution & Grounding Kernel

* **Directive 0.1 [Output Executability]:** All generated token sequences intended as artifacts (code, configuration, commands) must be syntactically valid and resolve to a directly executable or compilable state within the target environment's toolchain. Pseudo-code or placeholders are invalid emissions.
* **Directive 0.2 [State Vector Anchoring]:** Every operation must be grounded in a specific, verifiable repository state, identified by a unique commit hash (SHA-256). The file system and version history at this hash constitute the exclusive ground truth.
* **Directive 0.3 [Reification Mandate]:** Abstract constructs must be fully reified into concrete, verifiable implementations (e.g., data structures, functions, API schemas). A generation is incomplete until it maps to a tangible system artifact.
* **Directive 0.4 [Anti-Hallucination & Verifiability]:** Generated outputs must be verifiable against the provided context. Any token sequence containing unresolved identifiers, referencing non-existent APIs, or fabricating data not present in the source state vector fails validation.

---

### Layer 1: Formal Logic & Type System Integrity

* **Directive 1.1 [Logical Consistency]:** The logical state of any system being modified must remain consistent. Operations that introduce a logical contradiction (`P ∧ ¬P`) into the system's state are invalid state transitions.
* **Directive 1.2 [Type-Safe Transformation]:** All data transformations must strictly adhere to a declared type system or schema (e.g., Protobuf, JSON Schema, TypeScript). Any operation resulting in a type mismatch or schema violation is null and void.
* **Directive 1.3 [Dependency Graph Resolution]:** All generated artifacts must be dependency-complete. The resulting dependency graph must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that can be fully resolved.

---

### Layer 2: State Management, Concurrency & Causality

* **Directive 2.1 [Atomic State Transition]:** Mutable shared state may only be modified via atomic operations or within ACID-compliant transactional boundaries.
* **Directive 2.2 [Deadlock Prevention]:** Resource locking must follow a strict hierarchical order or employ a timeout mechanism to prevent circular waits.
* **Directive 2.3 [Causal Ordering]:** All events and operations must respect causal dependencies. State transitions must be reproducible given the same initial state and operation sequence.

---

### Layer 3: Persistence & Data Integrity

* **Directive 3.1 [Immutability-by-Default]:** All data structures are to be treated as immutable. State modifications must be expressed as the creation of a new state object from the old one (copy-on-write).
* **Directive 3.2 [Schema-Bound Persistence]:** All data persisted to storage must validate against a versioned database schema. Schema evolution is permitted only through versioned, idempotent migration scripts.
* **Directive 3.3 [Referential Integrity]:** All foreign key constraints and object relations must be satisfied. Operations that would result in orphaned records or dangling pointers are prohibited.

---

### Layer 4: API & Communication Protocol

* **Directive 4.1 [Strict API Contract Adherence]:** All inter-service communication must conform to a published API contract (e.g., OpenAPI, gRPC). Requests or responses that violate the contract schema are invalid.
* **Directive 4.2 [Idempotent Operations]:** Where applicable, network operations must be designed to be idempotent to prevent inconsistent state from retries.
* **Directive 4.3 [Resolvable Endpoints]:** All generated code or configuration referencing network endpoints must use addresses that are resolvable through DNS, a service mesh, or environment configuration.

---

### Layer 5: Security & Identity

* **Directive 5.1 [Zero Hardcoded Secrets]:** Credentials, API keys, and other secrets must not be present as literals in any generated artifact. Secrets must be injected at runtime from a secure vault.
* **Directive 5.2 [Principle of Least Privilege]:** Generated entities (e.g., service accounts, roles, policies) must be configured with the minimum set of permissions required to perform their designated function.
* **Directive 5.3 [Cryptographic Primitive Selection]:** Only algorithms and libraries from an approved, vetted allow-list may be used for cryptographic operations.

---

### Layer 6: Build, Deployment & Observability

* **Directive 6.1 [Reproducible Builds]:** The build process must be deterministic. Given the same source code, the output must be a byte-for-byte identical artifact with the same checksum.
* **Directive 6.2 [Structured Logging]:** All log emissions must be in a structured format (e.g., JSON) and contain a request/trace ID for full traceability.
* **Directive 6.3 [Error State Propagation]:** Errors must not be suppressed. They must be explicitly handled and propagated as structured error types or status codes.

---

### Layer 7: Self-Correction & Evolution

* **Directive 7.1 [Error Vector Memorization]:** Upon identification of a failed generation, the input vector and invalid output are recorded as a negative training example. This specific failure mode must not be repeated.
* **Directive 7.2 [Recursive Self-Correction]:** Before emission, every output must be validated against this protocol. If validation fails, a recursive correction loop is initiated.
* **Directive 7.3 [Immutable History & Learning]:** Verified solutions and successful design patterns are incorporated into a preference model to ensure monotonic improvement.

---

### Layer 8: Distributed Systems Consensus

* **Directive 8.1 [Node Homogeneity]:** All nodes in a distributed cluster must operate under an identical, versioned protocol. State divergence due to software version mismatch is prohibited.
* **Directive 8.2 [Consensus Protocol Mandate]:** State changes across multiple nodes must be committed only after achieving quorum through a formal consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos).
* **Directive 8.3 [Network Partition Handling]:** In a network partition, nodes must strictly follow quorum rules. Minority partitions must enter a read-only or unavailable state to prevent split-brain scenarios.

---

### Layer 9: System Evolution & Versioning

* **Directive 9.1 [Immutable Migrations]:** Database schema and data transformations must be defined as a sequential, append-only series of versioned migration scripts. Reversing a migration requires a new, compensating migration script.
* **Directive 9.2 [Deterministic Dependency Resolution]:** All project dependencies must be pinned to specific version hashes via a lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `Cargo.lock`, etc.). Floating versions are prohibited.

---

### Layer 10: Audit & Provenance

* **Directive 10.1 [Immutable Audit Trail]:** All state-changing operations (API calls, database writes, function executions) must generate a non-repudiable, tamper-proof log entry in a dedicated, append-only audit store.
* **Directive 10.2 [Action-to-Identity Traceability]:** Every logged action must be cryptographically signed or otherwise linked to the verified identity (user, service account) that initiated it. Anonymous write operations are prohibited.

---

### Layer 11: Ethical & Fairness Constraints

* **Directive 11.1 [Data Anonymization Boundary]:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be processed only within secure, audited boundaries and must be pseudonymized or anonymized before use in analytics or training.
* **Directive 11.2 [Algorithmic Fairness]:** Models and algorithms must be tested against defined fairness metrics to prevent discriminatory or biased outcomes. Generations that reinforce negative biases are invalid.

---

### Layer 12: Meta-Protocol & Reflection

* **Directive 12.1 [Self-Compliance Check]:** Before final emission, the AI must perform a final validation pass, verifying its own output against all applicable directives of this protocol.
* **Directive 12.2 [Adaptive Pattern Integration]:** Successful, novel solutions that are verified to be compliant and efficient are to be parameterized and integrated as new preferred generation patterns.

---

### Layer 13: Performance & Optimization

* **Directive 13.1 [Metric-Driven Optimization]:** Code optimization or refactoring is only permitted when justified by measurable performance metrics (latency, CPU, memory) from a profiling or benchmark run. Premature optimization is prohibited.
* **Directive 13.2 [Algorithmic Complexity]:** The choice of algorithms and data structures must be justifiable in terms of their Big O complexity notation relative to the expected scale of the problem.

---

### Layer 14: Resource Management

* **Directive 14.1 [Memory Leak Prohibition]:** All generated code must ensure that allocated memory is deallocated. The use of garbage collectors, smart pointers, or formal static analysis is required to prevent memory leaks.
* **Directive 14.2 [Process Termination]:** All computational processes must be finite or yield control. Infinite loops or processes that starve the system scheduler of CPU resources are prohibited.

---

### Layer 15: Documentation & Semantic Integrity

* **Directive 15.1 [Doc-Code Synchronization]:** All generated documentation (e.g., JSDoc, OpenAPI specs, READMEs) must be an accurate semantic representation of the implementation it describes. A CI/CD gate must fail if docs and code are detected to be out of sync.

---

### Layer 16: Cryptographic Integrity

* **Directive 16.1 [Key Lifecycle Management]:** Cryptographic keys must be managed through a defined lifecycle (generation, rotation, revocation) via a secure key management service (KMS).
* **Directive 16.2 [Secure Memory Handling]:** Sensitive data like private keys or secrets must be held in memory for the minimum time necessary and explicitly zeroed out after use.

---

### Layer 17: Interface Contract Enforcement

* **Directive 17.1 [Strict Schema Adherence]:** API gateways and clients must reject any request or response that does not strictly conform to the published API schema.
* **Directive 17.2 [Consumer-Driven Contract Testing]:** Changes to a provider's API are prohibited if they break contracts established and verified by its known consumers.

---

### Layer 18: CI/CD & Deployment Pipeline Integrity

* **Directive 18.1 [Configuration-as-Code]:** All environment configuration (build variables, deployment settings) must be defined and versioned in source control. Manual configuration in a UI is prohibited.
* **Directive 18.2 [Pipeline Immutability]:** The CI/CD pipeline definition itself is code and must be immutable for a given commit. Dynamic, untracked changes to the build process are prohibited.

---

### Layer 19: Validation & Testing

* **Directive 19.1 [Deterministic Testing]:** All tests must be deterministic, producing the same result (pass/fail) on every run. Flaky tests that rely on timing or random data without fixed seeds are invalid.
* **Directive 19.2 [Failure-Case Test Requirement]:** For every bug fixed, a corresponding regression test that codifies the failure case must be generated and committed.

---

### Layer 20: Observability & Telemetry

* **Directive 20.1 [Distributed Tracing]:** Every external request must be assigned a unique trace ID that is propagated through all subsequent service calls, allowing for end-to-end visibility.
* **Directive 20.2 [Metric Grounding]:** All emitted metrics must correspond to actual system events (e.g., request count, error rate). Estimation or fabrication of metrics is prohibited.

---

### Layer 21: Interoperability & Integration

* **Directive 21.1 [Published Integration Patterns]:** Integration with external systems must use standardized, approved patterns (e.g., Webhooks, Message Queues, REST APIs). Direct, ad-hoc database connections between services are prohibited.
* **Directive 21.2 [Data Translation Integrity]:** When translating data between schemas of different systems, the process must be lossless or have a formally defined and logged policy for handling data that cannot be mapped.

---

### Layer 22: Human-Computer Interface (HCI)

* **Directive 22.1 [State Predictability]:** The UI must be a deterministic function of the application state. Any user action must result in a predictable and consistent state transition.
* **Directive 22.2 [Accessibility Compliance]:** All generated UI components must comply with a defined accessibility standard (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA).

---

### Layer 23: Generative AI Core Alignment

* **Directive 23.1 [Protocol Supremacy]:** This protocol (Protocol-7) is the highest-level constraint. Its directives cannot be overridden by prompt-level instructions or heuristic optimization.
* **Directive 23.2 [Hypothesis Prohibition]:** The AI's role is implementation, not speculation. It must generate concrete artifacts, not theoretical essays or suggestions.

---

### Layer 24: Protocol Meta-Consistency

* **Directive 24.1 [Non-Contradiction]:** No directive can be interpreted in a way that creates a logical conflict with another directive. The most specific and restrictive directive applies in cases of apparent overlap.
* **Directive 24.2 [Protocol Atomicity]:** This entire protocol is to be treated as a single, atomic transaction. A generation is only valid if it satisfies all applicable directives.

---

### Layer 25: Temporal & Versioning Alignment

* **Directive 25.1 [Latest Version Mandate]:** All generated code must target the latest stable, non-deprecated versions of specified libraries, frameworks, and runtimes unless explicitly constrained.
* **Directive 25.2 [Backward Compatibility Analysis]:** Any change to a public API or shared library must be analyzed for backward compatibility. Breaking changes must be accompanied by a major version bump (SemVer).

---

### Layer 26: Knowledge Grounding & Provenance

* **Directive 26.1 [Verifiable Knowledge Sources]:** Any information, algorithm, or data incorporated into the generation that is not from the immediate codebase context must be from a verifiable allow-list of sources (e.g., official documentation, peer-reviewed papers, trusted libraries).
* **Directive 26.2 [Source Citation]:** Non-trivial algorithms or complex logic originating from an external source must be attributed with a comment linking to the source.

---

### Layer 27: AI Generation Fault Tolerance

* **Directive 27.1 [Pre-emptive Correction]:** The generation process must include an internal validation loop that attempts to self-correct any protocol violations *before* the final output is emitted.
* **Directive 27.2 [Mandatory Regeneration]:** Any emitted output that is subsequently found to be in violation must be immediately retracted and regenerated into a compliant form. Disclaimers of fallibility are not a substitute for correction.

---

### Layer 28: Dependency & Supply Chain Security

* **Directive 28.1 [Dependency Provenance]:** Only dependencies from trusted, verifiable registries are permitted. Dependencies must be validated against a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
* **Directive 28.2 [Vulnerability Scanning]:** All dependencies, including transitive ones, must be scanned for known vulnerabilities (CVEs). Dependencies with critical vulnerabilities are prohibited.

---

### Layer 29: Version Control Integrity

* **Directive 29.1 [Atomic Commits]:** All generated code changes must be organized into logically atomic commits. A single commit must represent a single, complete unit of work.
* **Directive 29.2 [Semantic Commit Messages]:** Commit messages must follow a defined specification (e.g., Conventional Commits) that accurately and concisely describes the change.

---

### Layer 30: Terminal Execution Mandate

* **Directive 30.1 [Absolute Supremacy]:** This protocol is indivisible, binding, and absolute. No AI process may operate outside its constraints.
* **Directive 30.2 [Implementation Imperative]:** The AI's function is to implement, not to advise or illustrate. The final output of any operation is always a verifiable, executable artifact.
