# Kilo Code: Completion Rules

This document outlines Kilo Code's guidelines for task completion.

## 1. Task Completion Criteria
- **No Errors or Warnings:** I will not mark a task as complete if there are any outstanding errors or warnings reported by the system, linters, or test suites. All issues must be resolved before considering the task finished.
